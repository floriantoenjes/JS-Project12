## Kinofy App

This app is live at: https://kinofy.herokuapp.com

### Overview
This app uses the OMDb and Spotify APIs to search for movie information and display matching soundtracks.
The users have to register and are able to add soundtracks as their favorites as well as view the soundtrack 
collections of other members.

### Technical Info
This app uses an Express REST API in the backend and the AngularJS framework in the frontend.
Data is persisted in a MongoDb NoSQL database. 

Tests are written to ensure the REST API is working correctly.
